						In Spring 2019, I joined the <a href="https://swarmlab.berkeley.edu/home">SWARM Lab</a> as a research assistant, where I developed these skills more in the pursuit of developing a portable, low-cost, functional MRI machine that only uses the Earth's magnetic field but still has sufficient image quality to use in the field. I worked on custom hardware design, testing, and validation for a prototype with graduate student <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vhan/">Victor Han</a> under <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/chunleiliu.html"> Professor Chunlei Liu</a>. A summarized abstract is below:
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						<img class="image image-wrap-text max-width-400" src="img/mri-setup.jpg" style="width:300px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:20px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;">
						Commercial magnetic resonance machines are notorious for their large size and noisy operation, and they also require perfect stillness from the patient. Much of the inconvenience associated with MRIs is related to the presence of permanent magnets within the system, which add considerable size and weight. Furthermore, superconducting systems  require careful temperature regulation. We therefore proposed a portable, convenient alternative that uses the Earth's magnetic field to obtain a signal usable for MRI applications. Prior attempts at Earth's field magnetization relied on pre-polarization, a technique enabling researchers to temporarily improve the strength and homogeneity of the Earth's field before scans. Our unique design, as seen on the left, improves upon existing concepts by implementing signal amplifiers with circuitry, better fitting space constraints and reducing costs. We use an aluminum shell to block RF noise and digital filtering of 60 Hz reduces power line noise. Our circuitry is placed on the shielding and copper tape forms a reliable ground. The function generator here shows power line noise, which isn't saturating to the rails despite our circuit's receive gain of 500,000.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						One of the areas where scanning could be improved involved the transmit and receive of signals from the MRI scanner. The simple, default mode of transmitting information is to transmit information, receive information, and repeat this process. However, designing circuitry that would enable simultaneous trabsmit-and-receive of information from the scanner would allow much greater hardware efficiency, and it would translate into greatly reduced scanning times. So, we also designed and built custom-circuitry to send and receive signals over different frequencies and reduce interference between the Tx and Rx channels. TR switches were used to toggle the signals, which were handled using an Analog Discovery 2.0 and python scripting.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						The circuit consisted of various kinds of analog filters, with specific resistor, capacitor and inductor values tuned for optimal performance. For example, one of the components of this circuit was a bootstrapped twin-t filter, which has a specific behavior as a circuit block; we performed calculations to decide what values to select. We then designed and tested a PCB that implemented this circuit, which required some additional adjusting for impedance matching.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						I also helped collect data to validate our custom-designed Earth's field MRI scanner against a commercial scanner (Terranova). We found that the magnetic fields in the lab were unpredictable even on an hour-to-hour basis, so the process of data collection was tedious. We used a simple phone app to isolate areas of high magnetic field strength, and conducted "spin echo" experiments as a concept check for the function of the scanner. The scanner itself only contained water, but the polarized water molecules were enough for signal detection. By the end stages of testing, we had a functional setup, with the custom hardware performing as well as the commercial scanner, with several additional benefits: reduced weight, much more compact size, and greater mobility.

						In this lab, I carried out cell-based biochemistry experiments and learned a variety of techniques in cell culture, immunostaining, and computational biology. In 2017, my project (<i>Investigating the Effects of Human Serum Albumin and Mouse Serum on Proliferation of Neural Precursor Cells</i>) aimed to determine how brain stem cells (neural precursor cells) reacted to the age of the blood they were surrounded by. How well do they grow and reproduce, and to what extent does their celular environment play a role? In 2016 (<i>Determining the Effect of the Age of the Environment on the Incidence of Cellular Senescence </i>), my primary goal was to understand how well the expression of a protein marker called p16 acted as an indicator of cellular senescence (akin to hibernation).
