              <u>Scripting Efficiency:</u> Over the past 3 semesters, I have optimized the back-end of 16A software significantly, expanding the Makefile-based content deployment system. For example, there's a platform called Datahub which can automatically host iPython notebooks for students to complete their assignments without painful local installations. I ensured that the content deployment was seamlessly integrated with Datahub. I also maintain the class "status check," which is a tool students can use to check all of their grades in the class.

            <p class="text">
              <u>Study Group Formation:</u> I am currently part of a team writing a fully flexible framework to form study-groups for students based on survey responses, to facilitate remote learning in Fall 2020. The final product will be enormously adaptable and scalable; any class can use it simply by specifying matching criteria and priorities. The results of this project will be measured with feedback surveys, and this tool will enable any Professor to enhance the engagement of their students, especially in a time when many may feel left behind.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <u>Website Overhaul:</u> This summer (2020), I revamped the website completely, incorporating additional useful features such as dynamic calendar highlighting, the ability to toggle course staff bios, helpful button display text, and more. Not to mention, the website aesthetics are now far more elegant, with a color theme, intuitive table structures, and an updates section synched with the Piazza class forum.

              <u>Textbook I Wrote:</u> In Summer 2020, I wrote <a href="https://bit.ly/eecs16a_compendium">a book</a> that contains condensed content summaries and detailed practice problem solutions for all of the major concepts in the class. I've gotten very good feedback on the book, from students, TAs, and professors alike. I take the time to thoroughly explain problem-solving strategies, using high-quality LaTeX diagrams (small selection <a href="gallery">here</a>). Spanning 12 chapters, the book has received over 8k visits so far since its deployment in mid-July 2020.

              <u>iPython Notebooks:</u> In my first semester as a TA, I created several iPython notebooks on concepts such as determinants, linear systems, eigenvalues, and OMP. Linear algebra doesn't have to remain purely abstract; there's a lot to be learned from knowing how to visualize concepts (yes, there's a theme to my teaching philosphy ðŸ˜Š). I'd say the OMP notebook is my best one, and you can see all my demos listed under Fa19 <a href="https://eecs16a.org/#sims" target="_blank">here</a>.

              <u>Teaching Philosophy:</u> In my teaching, I strive to focus on communicating foundational concepts with full clarity; this will ensure that in exams and beyond, students can spend more time solving problems than re-learning past content or doubting their approach. Fa20 makes my 4th semester as a TA with a lot of teaching before that, but it'll be my first formal discussion section; I'm very excited!

              <u>iPython Circuits Notebook:</u> I worked with 2 other students to create a circuits-oriented iPython notebook that showcased `lcapy`, a convenient way to build circuit diagrams and analyze circuit configurations (symbolically and numerically) in iPython. The notebook allows students to better understand circuit behavior. This goes far beyond a simulation tool like Falstad or even Spice; the convenience/usefulness tradeoff is unbeaten by lcapy. For any circuit, you can find the frequency response, cutoff frequencies, a bode plot, the thevenin equivalent, and so much more. Our professor, <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html">Anant Sahai</a> took note of our work, awarding us extra credit in the class and recommending us for TA positions next fall.
