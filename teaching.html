              I am currently part of a team writing a fully flexible framework to form study-groups for students based on survey responses, to facilitate remote learning in Fall 2020. The final product will be enormously adaptable and scalable; any class can use it simply by specifying matching criteria and priorities. The algorithms handle the rest! The results of this will be measured with feedback surveys incorporated into the class curriculum; if it is effective, this could constitute a remarkably useful took that any class can use to enhance the engagement of its students, especially in a time when many are feeling isolated or left behind due to the minimal in-person interaction.

              Over the past 3 semesters, I have also optimized the back-end of 16A software significantly by expanding the scope of the the Makefile-based content deployment system. For example, one of the main developments is with regards to a platform called Datahub; this hub can automatically host iPython notebooks for students to complete their assignments online, mitigating the hassle of local installations. I ensured that the content deployment was seamlessly integrated with Datahub for maximum efficiency and convenience, allowing students to focus more on learning and less on technical issues. I also maintain the class "status check," which is a tool students can use to check all of their grades in the class.

              This summer (2020), I revamped the website completely, incorporating additional useful features such as javascript-based calendar highlighting, the ability to toggle course staff bios, helpful button display text, and more. Not to mention, the website aesthetics are now far more elegant, with a color theme, intuitive table structures, and an updates section synched with Piazza.

              This summer, I wrote <a href="https://bit.ly/eecs16a_compendium">a book</a> that contains condensed content summaries and detailed practice problem solutions for all of the major concepts in the class. I've gotten very good feedback on the book, from students, TAs, and professors alike. I take the time to carefully and thoroughly explain problem-solving strategies, using high-quality native LaTeX diagrams such as those pictured in the slideshow below. Spanning 12 chapters, the book has received over 1.2k clicks so far since its deployment in mid-July.

              In my first semester as a TA, I created several iPython notebooks on concepts such as determinants, linear systems, eigenvalues, and OMP to help students understand how linear algebra doesn't have to remain purely abstract. There's a lot to be learned from knowing how to visualize concepts (yes, there's a theme to my teaching philosphy ðŸ˜Š). I'd say the OMP notebook is my best one, and you can see all my demos listed under Fa19 <a href="https://eecs16a.org/#sims" target="_blank">here</a>.

              In my teaching, I'll strive to focus on communicating foundational concepts with full clarity; this will ensure that in exams and beyond, students can spend more time solving problems than re-learning past content. Fa20 makes my 4th semester as a TA with a lot of teaching before that, but it'll be my first formal discussion section; I'm very excited!

              The 16A software team also has some very big plans to integrate technology with discussions for remote learning; stay tuned!

              In Fa19 and Sp20, I provided software support for EECS 16B, performing a subset of my responsiblities for 16A. Due to budget constraints, my appointment to 16B was not official; I solely focused on ensuring that students had the best experience possible, working across 16A and 16B.

              I worked with 2 other students to create a circuits-oriented iPython notebook that showcased `lcapy`, a very convenient way to build circuit diagrams and analyze circuit configurations (symbolically and numerically) in iPython. The notebook allows students to gain a better understand of circuit behavior by building and analyzing their own circuits. This goes far beyond a simulation tool like Falstad or even Spice; the convenience/usefulness tradeoff is unbeaten by lcapy. For any circuit, you can find the symbolic frequency response, cutoff frequencies, a bode plot, the thevenin equivalent, and so much more. Our professor, <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html">Anant Sahai</a> took note of our work and not only awarded us extra credit in the class, but also recommended us for TA positions next fall.
