    					In this 10-week internship, I built, programmed, and tested a custom hearing aid device. Most details are proprietary (as are the cool pictures I have), but as an overview, I worked on several aspects of the project: I fine-tuned the DSP parameters of the IC to ensure optimal performance for various operating conditions. Along the way, I validated the core chipset extensively using test equipment and a development board. Since I was the only person working on this project, I completed full-stack board bring-up, including the hardware, firmware and software components of the project. As a secondary feature for the hearing aid, I laid the groundwork for Bluetooth Speech-To-Text capabilities using an open-source API. In the process of hardware manufacturing and debugging, I did a <i>lot</i> of hand-soldering and reflow soldering, spending nearly 10 hours a week in front of the iron and fume extractor. I performed precision hand-soldering (0402-sized components) and learned reflow soldering for smaller (0201) components and ball-grid arrays (BGA).

    					The development of a next-gen, hyper-performant hearing aid is necessary, as the market is shifting its focus to certain key areas, such as dealing with increased algorithmic complexity, enabling more powerful chips in smaller packages, and incorporating firmware-over-the-air technologies. But hearing aids as they exist now are already quite effective; introducing fundamentally unique features, such as what I worked on, could signal a paradigm-shift in education-based applications, and this is where I focused a lot of my energies. I'd also worked on <a href="projects#signify">a project</a> with a similar focus for a hackathon, so it aligned quite well with my background and expertise. MuMec is still continuing this project, but for details on the background and market research that motivated me to dive into this project, see <a href="project_materials/mumec-background.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
