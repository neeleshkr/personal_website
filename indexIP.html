						<p class="text">
							Over summer 2020, I wrote a book for the class I'm TA'ing, EECS 16A. It contains condensed content summaries corresponding to the course notes, as well as detailed and insightful practice problems and solutions. Check out the most recent version <a href="https://www.eecs16a.org/EECS16ACompendiumOfNotesAndPracticeProblems.pdf">here!</a>

						<hr>
						<p class="text">
							I am an electrical engineering undergraduate student who enjoys integrating my interest in circuits with my knowledge in software systems and scripting. Having formally studied programming, OS, and systems at UC Berkeley but primarily worked on PCBs, circuits, IC chips, development boards, etc. in my research and other club/class projects, I enjoy improving hardware design and efficiency by exploring the EE/CS interface.

						<hr>
						<p class="text">
							My interest in physics and math in high school quickly grew into a love of problem-solving after my first electrical engineering internship at ATX Networks, where I primarily worked on optimizing an optical network performance model to enhance the placement of telecom equipment. Once at UC Berkeley as a college student, I realized that I specifically enjoy analyzing, designing, and optimizing circuits. Additionally, though I didn't yet have much of a background in computer science, I quickly gained familiarity with various tools and technologies through my coursework learning through exposure to my more CS-oriented peers.
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							I joined the <a href="https://swarmlab.berkeley.edu/home">SWARM Lab</a> as a research assistant, where I developed these skills more in the pursuit of developing a portable, functional MRI machine with sufficient image quality to use in the field. I worked on custom hardware design, testing, and validation for a prototype Earth's-field MRI machine with graduate student <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vhan/">Victor Han</a> under <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/chunleiliu.html"> Professor Chunlei Liu</a>.
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							I also served as Director of the Professional Development Committee for UC Berkeley's IEEE Student Branch. Over my 4 terms on the committee, I helped organize over 20 events and originated a dozen new event ideas. The events spanned from Research Meet-and-Greets to help undergraduates engage with research to Technical Writing and Personal Website Design Workshops to help student build their communication skills and professional brand. IEEE introduced me to some of the brightest minds on campus, ensuring that I had a place to ask informed questions about classes and Berkeley life. I've been able to give some of this advice back as an IEEE mentor for incoming students.
