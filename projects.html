    					I spent 2 very stimulating, fast-paced years with the <a href="https://fsae.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Formula Racing</a> Team, most recently as Electrical Subsystem Co-Lead. In this organization, students design, build, and race a fully functional Formula-1 style racecar at the annual <a href="https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events">Formula SAE competition</a>. I had the chance to work with a team of 60 remarkably dedicated fellow students with a similar passion for fast cars. We all spent 20 hours a week on the car, at the minimum! My first year, our team placed 16th place overall out of over 80 competitive college teams; our second year, we couldn't compete in person due to COVID-19 ðŸ˜”.

    				<p class="text">
    					Elected as Director of the Professional Development Committee for UC Berkeley's <a href="https://ieee.berkeley.edu/">IEEE Student Branch</a>, I helped organize over 20 events and originated a dozen new event ideas. The events spanned from Research Meet-and-Greets to help undergraduates engage with research to Technical Writing and Personal Website Design Workshops to help student build their communication skills and professional brand. IEEE introduced me to some of the brightest minds on campus, ensuring that I had a place to ask informed questions about classes and Berkeley life. I've been able to give some of this advice back as an IEEE mentor.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              In my EE 130 device design class, I used TCAD (Sentaurus Workbench) to numerically simulate the behavior of the custom-designed NMOS device. The channel length was specified at 25 nm based on the current 20 nm CMOS generation. The goal for this project was to become more familiar with how real-world transistors are designed, keeping specifications and tradeoffs in mind. I explored the effects of various parameters and extracted useful information from the softwareâ€™s simulation capabilities in order to optimize current consumption (<math>I_{on}</math> and <math>I_{off}</math>), subthreshold swing, and transconductance. I furthermore used my knowledge of device physics to explain what implications a certain design decision would have, and the rationale behind my choices. As can be expected, most design parameters presented a tradeoff and interacted with each other in complex ways.

            <p class="text">
              The software self-consistently solves the electrostatics equations for a given set of device parameters to numerically determine the current at different applied gate and drain voltages. It also constructs images of device layouts for visualization purposes. The parameters experimented with include channel doping, source/drain extension depths, various dopant concentrations, the gate-dielectric spacer length, and others. By optimizing the parameters, I achieved an <math>\frac{I_{on}}{I_{off}}</math> ratio of <math>1.04 * 10^{18}</math>, 21 times better than the default value.
