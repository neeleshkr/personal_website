						<h2 class="add-top-margin">About Me</h2>
						<a class="anchor" id="intro"></a>
						<hr>
						<p class="text">
							As an electrical engineering undergraduate student, I enjoy integrating my interest in circuits with my knowledge of software systems and scripting. I've formally studied programming, OS, and systems at UC Berkeley but primarily worked with PCBs, circuits, ICs, development boards, etc. in my <a href="research">research</a> and other <a href="projects">club/class projects</a>. I'm always looking to integrate these domains, improving hardware design and efficiency by exploring the EE/CS interface.
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							My interest in physics and math in high school quickly grew into a love of application-oriented problem-solving after my first electrical engineering internship at <a href="work#atx">ATX Networks</a>. There, after familiarizing myself with the full suite of hardware test equipment, I primarily worked on optimizing an optical network performance model to enhance the placement of telecom equipment. Once at UC Berkeley as a college student, I realized that I specifically enjoy analyzing, designing, and optimizing circuits. Additionally, though I didn't yet have much of a background in computer science, I quickly gained familiarity with various tools and technologies through my coursework and by learning from my more CS-oriented peers. Most recently, I <a href="work#mumec">worked with a startup, MuMec</a>, to build a next-gen hearing aid device with news features and optimal performance metrics.
						</p>
						<p class="text">
							I view the pursuit of knowledge as akin to building the ideal spider web. Building many flimsy strands in a bunch of new directions may seem productive at the start because they cover so much area, but the web itself won't last long. It's far better to build a sturdy base as a foundation to springboard new intellectual endeavors off of. In this way, I think of new topics I encounter as wispy strands, and I've found that studying in a shallow way, accumulating these more and more doesn't lead to the best outcome. By the time I'd learned something new, I had forgotten what I'd learned before; my web wasn't really growing. It's worked far better for me to solidify core concepts and understand them really well, to the point where <a href="teaching">teaching</a> someone else about them and helping them visualize concepts through my eyes becomes second-nature.
